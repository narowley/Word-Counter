# Overview

I have realized that there is more to programing than just understanding one language. It takes an understanding of multiple languages to become a profecient programmer. To become a better software developer, I spent time with C++ and created a word counter. It can take any .txt file and calculate the number of words in the document as well as the word that occurs most often. I created this program so that I can demonstrate my progress in learning C++ as well as to demonstrate how C++ can excel at using outside sources as well how it handles different objects.

# Development Environment

To develop this peice of software, I used Visual Code Studio. VCS has built in packages to handle C++ so intergrating this into my current workspace wasn't an issue. When I was using C++, I didn't import any librarys that weren't preinstalled. For my program, I used iostream, string, fstream, vector, and algorithm for my header file library, and used standard naming for my programs.

# Future Work

In the future, I would like to improve the following:

- Increase efficiency, decrease runtime
- Introduce function to remove punctuation and special characters
- Introduce more functions to create cleaner code
